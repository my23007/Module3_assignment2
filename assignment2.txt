Introduction:
Cathy's decision to embark on the digitalization process, coupled with the establishment of an international supply chain and automated warehouses worldwide, has garnered attention from high-profile customers such as HRH the King and Prince Albert 2nd of Monaco. However, concerns have been raised regarding potential impacts on product quality and supply chain security. This executive summary aims to assess the probabilities of these changes endangering product quality and availability while providing recommendations to mitigate associated risks.
Calculations and Assumptions:
To estimate the risks to product quality and supply chain, we employ a quantitative risk assessment methodology, specifically the Monte Carlo simulation methods. Monte Carlo simulation enables us to assess the probabilities of these failure modes occurring. Olson and Wu (2017) argue that the simulation models like Monte Carlo utilize sets of assumptions related to the model components relationship and can be useful in gaining more insights of systems. Moreover, this method was chosen based on scientific evidence from academic references. For example, Ayu et al (2023) used the Monte Carlo simulation method to predict sales for small medium size companies. Similarly, Leopoulos et al (2006) explored risk managements tools for SMEs and they used the Monte Carlo approach. Moreover, Renna (2013) proposed the Monte Carlo simulation method for investment and growth decisions which is the context of Pampered pets.
Based on the quantitative analysis, the following potential risks to product quality and supply chain are identified along with their associated probabilities:
Loss of Quality Risks:
-	Supply chain disruptions leading to delays in delivery.
-	Quality control issues in automated warehouses resulting in damaged products
-	Cybersecurity breaches compromising data integrity 

Supply Chain Risks:
-	Transportation delays due to customs issues 
-	Failure of automated warehouse systems causing inventory inaccuracies 
-	Supplier bankruptcy leading to raw material shortages.

Regarding the probabilities, the assumption was made based on academic references; for instance, Käki et al (2015) examined disruptions in supply chain using probabilistic risk assessment and estimated the supplier impact to be around 19%. Similarly, 
Vilko el al (2012) studied transportation delays in supply chain, the simulation result yielded a mean value of 17%. Moreover, Hanafiah et al (2022) evaluated the Risk Assessment of Warehouse Operation and estimated the probability to be nearly 19%. Furthermore, Anthony et al (2016) estimated the probability of cybersecurity breach using healthcare data and found that it was close to 11%.
PERT method was applied to perform the estimation. Below is the formula used:
 PERT = P + 4*M + O / 6
where P is the pessimistic estimate under threat conditions, while O is the optimistic estimate during favorable situation, and M is the most likely when both conditions happen (knowledgehut,2024). PERT was applied based on case study by Karabulut (2017) where the author applied the Monte Carlo simulation and PERT approach in one of the planning projects.
The estimation is carried out for all metrics (transportation delay, supplier reliability, etc.) where a random number between ranges was chosen for the optimistic, pessimistic and most likely. the total was calculated using the formula, next the total was calculated over 1000 attempts using Microsoft Excel's "what if analysis" function. Finally, relevant charts and histograms were plotted to show the distribution and trend. Below are the summary tables, the calculation details and excel sheet are mentioned in Appendix A.

Transportation time
Transportation time	Assumption: Transportation delays due to customs issues (Probability: 17%)
Pessimistic	24
Most likely	20
Optimistic	14
Total using PERT	19.66666667

 

Supplier Reliability
Supplier Reliability	Assumption: Supply chain disruptions leading to delays in product delivery (Probability: 19%)
Pessimistic	48
Most likely	18
Optimistic	8
Total using PERT	21.33333333

 
Warehouse Efficiency:
Warehouse Efficiency	Assumption: Failure of automated warehouse systems causing inventory inaccuracies (Probability: 19%)
Pessimistic	33
Most likely	18
Optimistic	9
Total using PERT	19

 

Cybersecurity Breach:
Cybersecurity Breach	Assumption: Cybersecurity breaches compromising product data integrity (Probability: 11%) 
Pessimistic	22
Most likely	7
Optimistic	1
Total using PERT	8.5

 
Finally, overall probability was modeled against those variables using R. However, there is limitation since the data was based on assumptions instead of available historical data. The R program details is in Appendix B.
Potential Risks and Mitigation strategies according to priority:
1. Risk of Loss of Quality:
a. Potential Issues:
- Quality Control Failures in Automated Warehouses: With the implementation of automated warehouses, there is a risk of quality control failures leading to damaged or defective products. Automated systems may not detect subtle defects or damage during the handling process, resulting in compromised product quality. Giner et al (2023) highlight the demand for efficient warehouses to improve productivity, they argue that defective quantities can cause disruptions
- Transportation Delays Leading to Product Damage: International supply chain expansion increases the complexity of transportation logistics. Delays in transit, such as customs clearance issues or unexpected disruptions, can lead to prolonged exposure of products to unfavorable conditions, resulting in damage or spoilage. In this context, Paul et al (2019) argue that transportation disruption can be a major cause of business interruptions and create loss in product quality.
b. Mitigation Strategies:
- Implement Enhanced Quality Control Measures: Deploy advanced quality control systems within automated warehouses, including machine vision inspection and automated defect detection algorithms. Moreover, it would be advisable to conduct regular audits and inspections to ensure compliance with quality standards.
- Optimize Transportation Routes and Packaging: Utilize data-driven analytics to optimize transportation routes and schedules, minimizing the risk of delays. Furthermore, it is desirable to invest in robust packaging materials and techniques to protect products during transit, reducing the likelihood of damage
2. Risk of Supply Chain Issues:
a. Potential Issues:
- Transportation Delays: Complex international logistics increase the likelihood of transportation delays due to factors such as customs clearance, inclement weather, or geopolitical instability. Delayed shipments could disrupt the supply chain, which leads to product shortages and customer dissatisfaction.
- Supplier Bankruptcies: Dependence on a small number of suppliers poses a risk of supply chain disruption in the event of supplier bankruptcies or financial insolvency. Sudden supplier failures can result in raw material shortages, production delays, and increased costs. Gadge et al (2021) examined the supply chain risk related to bankruptcy, they argued that supply chain and sales will get disrupted as the default risk of a manufacturer increases
- Cybersecurity Breaches: Digitalization introduces vulnerabilities in the supply chain, including the risk of cybersecurity breaches. Unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as customer information or proprietary designs, can compromise business operations and damage reputation.
b. Mitigation Strategies:
- Diversify Supplier Base: Classify and onboard multiple suppliers for raw materials and critical components, which reduces the dependency on a single source. In addition, establish contracts with alternative suppliers to ensure continuity of supply in the event of supplier failures.
- Enhance Cybersecurity Measures: Implement vigorous cybersecurity procedure and protocols, including encryption, access controls, and threat detection systems. Furthermore, conducting regular security audits and employee training to mitigate the risk of cyber threats would be advisable.
- Establish Contingency Plans: Develop contingency plans for transportation disruptions, including alternative logistics routes and emergency protocols. Moreover, maintain buffer inventory levels to mitigate the impact of unexpected supply chain disruptions.
It would be equally important for the online shop to be compliant with the GDPR regulations, such as cookie consent, data privacy protection. GDPR compliance is essential for the online business and failure in compliance can imply punitive consequences which can reach a fine of 500,000 pounds (Foulsham et al, 2019).
Business continuity/ disaster recovery (DR) strategy
To ensure the business's online presence remains operational in the event of a disaster affecting the shop premises, we recommend implementing a comprehensive Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) strategy. Andrade et al (2017) highlight on the importance of disaster recovery solution in the current digitized environment to ensure business continuity.
This high-level strategy should include:
-	Redundant infrastructure: Deploy redundant servers and data centers to ensure high availability and minimize downtime.
-	Continuous data replication: Implement real-time data replication to ensure no data loss and minimal downtime in case of a disaster.
-	Automated failover: Utilize automated failover mechanisms to enable seamless transition to backup systems with less than a 1-minute changeover window.
-	Regular testing: Conduct regular testing and drills to verify the effectiveness of the DR solution and ensure readiness to handle any potential disasters.
The design will be based on Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service (DRaaS) which is a cloud-based solution proposed by Andrade et al (2017), and its being adopted by small and medium-sized organizations to ensure business continuity in context of disaster conditions. Moreover, Andrade et al (2017) highlight that this solution has lower operational costs as compared with the traditional solutions in the market.
 
Fig1: proposed solution (Andrade et al, 2017)
The disaster recovery solution proposed by Andrade et al (2017) has duplicate database servers and web application, and are matching to those that are active or running in the primary cloud or data center. Moreover, Andrade et al (2017) highlight that the storage volumes that are utilized by the main and secondary database servers are always reserved in a synchronized status. Moreover, there are basic components such as database servers and load balancers with auto-scaling in order to ensure high availability for those critical units. Andrade et al (2017) argue that this auto-scaling will benefit the company by allowing them to scale up or down the infrastructure based on the current situation.
 
Fig2: proposed infrastructure (Andrade et al, 2017)
Andrade et al (2017) explains that the disaster recovery infrastructure should be the same as the primary one in relation to the load balancer, web servers and database server and those are identical to the ones running in the primary infrastructure. In addition, they further highlight that on the occasion of a disaster, the disaster monitor would trigger the failover of the hosted or affected service from the primary into the secondary infrastructure. Once the primary infrastructure is fixed, then the disaster recovery cloud will trigger failback operation and return back to its hot-standby state as argued by Andrade et al (2017). The primary keys, such as the initial cost and the cost of data transfers, should be considered for the best disaster recovery strategy, it’s also important to take the organization's data requirements and disaster recovery goals into account (Alhazmi & Malaiya, 2013). In this context, the downside on this approach is that its costly, however, organizations should make a tradeoff between cost, and effectiveness of recovery (Andrade et al, 2017)
Regarding the choice of platform and vendor lock-in, consider leveraging cloud-based DR solutions from providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. These platforms offer scalable infrastructure, global availability, and managed services for DR, reducing the need for extensive upfront investment and maintenance. Moreover vendor-lock in can be avoided by adopting a multi-cloud strategy, where DR resources are spread across multiple cloud providers. This approach enhances resilience and flexibility while mitigating the risk of dependency on a single vendor. Furthermore, choosing solutions that adhere to open standards and provide robust APIs for interoperability. This allows for seamless integration with different platforms and technologies, reducing the risk of being tied to proprietary systems. In this context, Opara-Martins et al (2014) suggest standards bodies, academic practitioners and industry experts should follow the growth of cloud offerings with the purpose of simplifying the interoperability or compatibility among multiple cloud instances. Moreover, they argue that using Standards can be regularly proposed as a way to overcome vendor lock-in. For example, AWS offers a wide range of services for building robust DR solutions, including Amazon S3 for storage, Amazon EC2 for compute, and AWS Backup for data protection. To avoid vendor lock-in, it is advisable to utilize AWS's well-documented APIs and adhere to best practices for cloud architecture design. Furthermore, consider using open-source tools and frameworks that are compatible with multiple cloud platforms.

Conclusion:
In this report, we conducted a comprehensive risk assessment for Cathy's pet shop business as it undergoes digitalization and expands its operations to encompass an international supply chain and automated warehouses at a global level. The objective was to evaluate the probabilities of fluctuations to the operations endangering both the quality and availability of the company's products, and to design a robust business continuity/disaster recovery (BC/DR) strategy to ensure uninterrupted online presence. The risk assessment identified potential risks to product quality and supply chain security, utilizing quantitative risk modeling approach such as the Monte Carlo simulation. By quantifying the probabilities of various risks occurring, including quality control failures in automated warehouses and transportation delays in the supply chain, we provided actionable recommendations to mitigate these risks. Additionally, a comprehensive BC/DR strategy was designed to ensure continuous online presence and minimal data loss in the event of a disaster affecting the physical shop premises.
By implementing these recommendations, Cathy's business can proactively address the challenges posed by digitalization and international expansion, ensuring the preservation of product quality, supply chain resilience, and uninterrupted online operations.
